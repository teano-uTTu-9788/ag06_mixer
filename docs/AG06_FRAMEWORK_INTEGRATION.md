# AG06 Mixer Framework Integration Guide

## Overview

The AG06 mixer project has been successfully integrated with the Terminal Automation Framework, providing enhanced development workflows and audio-specific automation capabilities.

## Integration Date
- **Integrated**: 2025-08-28T12:03:54.864506
- **Framework Version**: 1.0.0
- **Integration Type**: Gradual Adoption

## Available Commands

### Standard Framework Commands
```bash
# Basic framework commands
./bin/dev doctor      # System health check
./bin/dev version     # Framework version
./bin/dev help        # Command help
```

### Audio-Specific Commands  
```bash
# AG06-specific audio development
./bin/dev-audio audio-doctor    # AG06 hardware validation
./bin/dev-audio audio-deploy    # Deploy audio processing
./bin/dev-audio audio-monitor   # Real-time monitoring
```

### Direct Audio Scripts
```bash
# Direct script access
./scripts/audio_dev_command.sh test      # Test audio setup
./scripts/audio_dev_command.sh validate  # Validate hardware
./scripts/audio_dev_command.sh monitor   # Monitor AG06
```

## Hardware Validation

The integration includes automatic AG06 hardware detection and validation:

```bash
# Validate AG06 connection
./scripts/hardware_validator.sh

# Comprehensive audio system check  
./bin/dev-audio audio-doctor
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Hardware Check**: Always start with hardware validation
   ```bash
   ./bin/dev-audio audio-doctor
   ```

2. **Development**: Use enhanced CLI for audio development
   ```bash
   ./bin/dev-audio audio-deploy
   ```

3. **Monitoring**: Monitor real-time performance
   ```bash  
   ./bin/dev-audio audio-monitor
   ```

## Integration Benefits

- ✅ Unified CLI interface for all development tasks
- ✅ Audio-specific automation and validation
- ✅ Hardware connection monitoring
- ✅ Framework consistency with other projects
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging
- ✅ Real-time monitoring capabilities

## Rollback

If needed, restoration from backup is available:
- **Backup Location**: Created automatically during integration
- **Rollback Process**: Replace current directory with backup

## Support

For framework-related issues:
- Check logs in `~/.local/log/dev-framework/`
- Run health checks with `./bin/dev doctor`
- Validate audio setup with `./bin/dev-audio audio-doctor`

## Next Steps

1. Familiarize team with new CLI commands
2. Integrate with existing audio processing workflows  
3. Setup continuous monitoring for production use
4. Expand automation based on development needs
