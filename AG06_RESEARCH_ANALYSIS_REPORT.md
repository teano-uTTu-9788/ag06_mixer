### Architecture Assessment
**File**: `/Users/nguythe/ag06_mixer/ag06_manu_workflow.py`

#### ✅ SOLID Compliance Analysis
1. **Single Responsibility**: ✅ Each component has one clear purpose
   - `AG06WorkflowOrchestrator`: Workflow execution only
   - `MonitoringProvider`: Observability only
   - `TestValidator`: Validation only

2. **Open/Closed**: ✅ Extensible via interfaces
   - `IWorkflowOrchestrator`, `IMonitoringProvider` abstractions
   - New workflows added without modifying existing code

3. **Liskov Substitution**: ✅ Interface implementations are substitutable
   - All implementations honor their interface contracts
   - Mock/test implementations work seamlessly

4. **Interface Segregation**: ✅ Focused interfaces
   - Separate interfaces for different concerns
   - No fat interfaces forcing unnecessary dependencies

5. **Dependency Inversion**: ✅ Abstractions over concretions
   - Constructor injection of dependencies
   - Factory pattern for object creation

### Performance Metrics (Current)
