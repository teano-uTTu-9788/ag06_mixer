## Getting Started

1. Initialize the orchestrator:
```python
from advanced_workflow_orchestrator import AdvancedWorkflowOrchestrator

orchestrator = AdvancedWorkflowOrchestrator()
```

2. Create specialized agents:
```python
from specialized_agent_factory import SpecializedAgentFactory

factory = SpecializedAgentFactory()
code_agent = await factory.create_agent('code_analyst', 'my_code_analyst')
```

3. Set up research pipeline:
```python
from research_implementation_pipeline import ResearchImplementationPipeline

pipeline = ResearchImplementationPipeline()
results = await pipeline.run_discovery_cycle()
```
