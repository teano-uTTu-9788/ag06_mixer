## üîß How to Use the Parallel Workflow System

### For Specialized Claude Instances

#### 1. Get Next Available Task
```bash
# Each specialist gets tasks from their category
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh next-task <category>

# Examples:
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh next-task audio_processing
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh next-task ui_development
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh next-task api_integration
```

#### 2. Assign Task to Yourself
```bash
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh assign <task_id> <your_instance_id>

# Example:
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh assign task_1756361788_2be1d884 audio_specialist
```

#### 3. Complete Task with Results
```bash
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh complete <task_id> "<detailed_result>"

# Example:
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh complete task_1756361788_2be1d884 "Implemented real-time pitch correction with configurable parameters. Auto-tune working with 5ms latency."
```

### For Monitoring and Coordination

#### Check Overall Status
```bash
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh status
```

#### Monitor Progress
```bash
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh monitor
# Opens real-time dashboard in terminal
```

#### Distribute Tasks Automatically
```bash
./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh distribute
# Automatically assigns pending tasks to available instances
```

## üöÄ Next Steps for Parallel Development

### Immediate Actions (For Each Claude Instance)
1. **Choose your specialization** based on the registered instances above
2. **Get your first task** using the next-task command
3. **Assign the task to yourself** 
4. **Begin implementation** following SOLID principles and AiOke standards
5. **Complete with detailed results** including metrics and technical details

### Coordination Protocol
- **Regular status checks** - Use `./parallel_workflow_orchestrator.sh status`
- **Task coordination** - Don't duplicate work, check assignments first
- **Quality standards** - All code must follow SOLID principles and include tests
- **Integration planning** - Consider how your component integrates with others

### Success Metrics to Achieve
- **Audio Processing**: Measurable quality improvements (SNR, THD, latency)
- **UI Development**: User experience metrics (load time, responsiveness, accessibility)
- **API Integration**: Reliability metrics (success rate, response time, error handling)
- **Testing**: Coverage metrics (test coverage, performance benchmarks, platform compatibility)
- **Documentation**: Completeness metrics (API coverage, user guide sections, examples)
- **Performance**: Quantifiable improvements (speed, memory usage, throughput)
