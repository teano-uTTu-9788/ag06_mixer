## üì± Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Week 1-2)
Each Claude instance works in parallel on assigned tasks:
- **ios_developer**: Creates Xcode project, implements UI
- **audio_engineer**: Builds audio engine, implements effects
- **app_store_specialist**: Prepares submission materials, demo content
- **qa_tester**: Creates test plans, validates on devices

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing (Week 2-3)  
- Combine individual components into complete app
- Comprehensive testing on multiple iOS devices
- TestFlight beta testing preparation
- Final App Store compliance validation

### Phase 3: App Store Submission (Week 3)
- Upload final build to App Store Connect
- Submit for App Store review
- Monitor review process and respond to feedback
- Coordinate launch marketing

## üîÑ Collaboration Workflow

### Daily Sync Protocol
1. **Morning Check-in**: Each instance reports progress on assigned tasks
2. **Blocker Resolution**: Address any technical or resource blockers
3. **Evening Status**: Update task completion and next-day priorities

### Integration Points
- **Audio + UI Integration**: audio_engineer + ios_developer
- **Testing Coordination**: qa_tester validates all components
- **Submission Preparation**: app_store_specialist coordinates final delivery

### Communication Channels
- **Universal Workflow System**: Task assignment and progress tracking
- **MANU Integration**: Autonomous agent coordination
- **Collaboration Dashboard**: Real-time progress visualization at `~/.universal_workflows/aioke_mvp/mvp_dashboard.html`
